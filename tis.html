			  <span class="image fit"><img src="images/newsletter 1.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
			  <span class="image fit"><img src="images/newsletter 2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
			  <p>Seeing major players in the IT sector like Huawei and Petronas was an eye-opening experience that went beyond the classroom. 
				Experiencing these firms' dynamic work environments allowed me to see directly how the ideas we study in academia are 
				used in real-world situations, in addition to showcasing their enormous scale and technological capability.</p>
			<p>Observing Petronas' assimilation of state-of-the-art technology for effective handling of resources and 
				Huawei's inventiveness in networking and telecommunications gave me a profound understanding of the nexus between theory 
				and practical application. </p>
			<p>The experience was a helpful reminder that academic undertakings shouldn't be pursued in a bubble; rather, 
				they should aim to support and enhance the innovative and forward-thinking cultures of prominent members of the business.</p>

			  <h3>Design Thinking</h3>
			  <span class=""><embed src="pdf/Design Thinking (Low Fidelity Prototype).pdf" /></br></span>
			  <span class=""><embed src="pdf/Design Thinking Information Systems (Group 12 slides).pdf" /></br></span>
			  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClTzuCNqa2c?si=un0Lo1G6-HyoEAMQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			  <p>The low-fidelity prototype created by fellow student during IT course has motivated me to consider 
				the tangible influence of theoretical knowledge in practical application.</p>			
			<p>The student's prototype displayed not only technical abilities, 
				but also a thorough awareness of user demands and the progressive nature of the design process. 
				This experience has taught me the importance of experiential learning in IT education, 
				which encourages students to interact directly with the tools and processes routinely used in industry.  </p>
			<p>It serves as a reminder that, beyond theoretical debates, 
				the ability to transfer ideas into actual prototypes is an essential talent for aspiring IT workers, 
				bridging the gap between academic knowledge and practical skills.</p>

				<h3>PC Assemble</h3>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pc assemble 1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image fit"><img src="images/pc assemble 2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
			  <p>Right before my mid-semester break, we were granted the opportunity to assemble a computer component.
				One of the training's main attractions was learning about each of the different elements of a computer system.</p>			
			<p>From the motherboard and CPU to the graphics card, RAM, and storage devices, 
				I obtained a thorough understanding of how these components work together to form one integrated computer unit. 
				The visual and sensory investigation of each component increased my respect for the complexity of today's computers.</p>
			<p>In short, the PC assembly workshop was a transforming experience that not only provided me with practical skills 
				but also increased my respect for the intricate details of computer technology. 
				The knowledge obtained and difficulties faced during the class will undoubtedly influence my way of thinking 
				about technology in the future.</p>
